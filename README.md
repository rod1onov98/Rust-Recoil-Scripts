# RustRecoilScripts

scripts for Rust for all types of weapons. Further development on your side is possible to bypass EAC virtual input block. in my project, VMulti is used for this (see `VMultiDriver.cs` in the project). a virtual mouse (HID) needs to be added there.

# Note
scripts were written in a single night, tested, and are ready for use and further development. the input-block bypass was found in less than an hour :D
